By following this resource, students will learn:

- How to collect reaction times to calculate rates of reactions
- How concentration and temperature affect the rate of chemical reaction
- That heat can be transfered by hot objects emitting IR radiation
- That different materials emit IR radiation at different rates
- How to create cooling curves from CSV data 
- That absorption of IR causes objects to become hot 
- That different materials absorb different amounts of IR radiation 
- That the transfer of heat can be stopped by an insulator
- That some materials are better at insulating than others
- That fermentation is the process of converting sugar and water into alcohol
- That the rate of fermentation is dependent on factors such as the temperature of the yeast
- That investigations using insects have to be carried out with consideration for the health of the insect
- How to plan an investigation to find out what colour habitats are preferred by different insects
- How to interpret results from choice chamber experiments
- How to measure temperature and humidity data using the Sense HAT
- What the products of aerobic respiration are
- How humidity and temperature are affected by aerobic respiration
