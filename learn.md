By creating a something with your Raspberry Pi students will learn:

- how to collect reaction times to calculate rates of reactions
- how concentration and temperature affect the rate of chemical reaction
- Understand that heat can be transfered by hot objects emitting IR radiation
- Understand that different materials emit IR radiation and different rates
- To create cooling curves from CSV data 
- Understand that absorption of IR causes objects to become hot 
- Understand that different materials absorb different amounts of IR radiations 
- Understand that the transfer of heat can be stopped by an insulator
- Understand that some materials are better at insulating than others
- Fermentation is the process of converting sugar and water into alcohol
- The rate of fermentation is dependent on factors such as the temperature of the yeast
- Investigations using insects have to be carried out with consideration for the health of the insect.
- How to plan an investigation to find out what colour habitats are preferred by different insects.
- Interpret results from choice chamber experiments
- How to measure temperature and humidity data using the Sense Hat
- The products of aerobic respiration
- How humidity and temperature are affected by aerobic respiration
- The stopping distance of a car is affected by both the thinking distance and braking distance.
- The factors which affect both the thinking distance and the braking distance.
