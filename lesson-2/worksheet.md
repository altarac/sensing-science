# Black and silver cans (investigating heat transfer by radiation)

In this lesson, you are going to investigate how the colour of a surface affects its ability to emit IR radiation.

## Theory 

Different coloured surfaces emit different amounts of IR radiation. During this practical, we will find out which coloured surface emits the most radiation.

## Experiment  

1. Heat water in a kettle and fill up the hot water bottle carefully, ensuring that any air is released before screwing the lid on.
1. Wrap a Raspberry Pi in a sandwich bag.
1. Wrap the Raspberry Pi in black paper.
1. Start the code and enter a suitable filename for the results.
1. Allow the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT to warm up for approximately ten minutes.
1. When instructed, remove the heat source and rewrap the Pi.
1. Enter the number of results required and the interval between each measurement.
1. Leave the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT to cool down.
1. Once the results have been collected, they will be written to a file which can be analyzed.
1. Replace the black paper with silver foil and repeat the steps above.

## Extension

Using a suitable spreadsheet, import both sets of data and produce a line graph comparing both sets of results.  

- Log into Google Sheets and start a new sheet:

  ![spread_sheet](images/spread_sheet.png)

- Import the first set of results. The pipe symbol `|` has been used to separate each column of results:

  ![import1](images/import.png)

- Import the second set of results and use the pipe symbol again to separate each column of results. This time, append the rows to the current sheet:

  ![import2](images/import2.png)

- You will now have two sets of results on the same sheet. Copy and paste the second set of results, tidy up the column headings, and remove any rows which are no longer needed:

  ![results1](images/results.png)
  
  ![results2](images/new_results.png)

- Highlight both sets of results and the time, and select New Chart:

  ![chart](images/chart.png)

- You will now have a finished chart which you can use to write a conclusion, identifying which material warmed up the quickest and was the best at absorbing IR radiation:
